### Week 0 - Hello World Tutorial Assignment

>I recently began work as a *Business Analyst* at **Northern Arizona University**, and was a *Software Dev* at **General Motors** for 5 years prior. This is my last course of instruction in the MS GIST program at UA. This entire field has been new to me, but I've learned a ton and quickly fell in love with it. Hoping to learn more about software options other than the ESRI suite of products, so that I have more tools at my disposal. I use quite a few open-source applications (such as Firefox and Ubuntu), but have never contributed other than submitting a bug report here and there. I spend most of my time exploring the backwoods of Northern AZ with my wife and our pup, reading fiction (mostly fantasy), gaming, and playing some DnD when I can get the gang together.
